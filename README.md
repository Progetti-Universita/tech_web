# AssicuraMe - Web technologies project

## Description
The content of this project was designed to pass the web technologies exam at the Parthenope University of Naples and is based on the creation of a car insurance quote which takes place through registration and authentication. For the quote, no third-party APIs are used, but it is a simple simulation to understand how to use the backend and fronted sides, ideal for those who are beginners in creating web applications.
